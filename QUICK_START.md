### Server Status
- The server is currently running in the background
- **Keep the terminal window open** - closing it will stop the server
- The server will automatically reload when you make code changes

### To Stop the Server
- Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where the server is running
- Or close the terminal window

### To Restart the Server
If you need to restart the server later, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Alternative Access Method
If port 5000 doesn't work, you can also try:
- `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
