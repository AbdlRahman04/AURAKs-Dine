## SLIDE 5: Technical Architecture
**Presenter 4** | **Duration: 65 seconds**

### Visual Content:
- Architecture diagram showing:
  - Frontend layer (React)
  - Backend layer (Node.js)
  - Database layer (PostgreSQL)
  - External services (Stripe, WebSocket)
- Technology logos

### Script:
"QuickDineFlow is built with modern, industry-standard technologies. Our frontend uses React 18 with TypeScript for type-safe, component-based development, styled with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components for accessibility.

The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, providing a RESTful API. We use PostgreSQL hosted on Neon for reliable, scalable data storage, with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations.

Real-time order updates are delivered via WebSocket connections, ensuring instant status changes. Payment processing is handled securely through Stripe, which is PCI-DSS compliant, meaning we never handle sensitive payment data directly.

The system is developed and deployed on Replit, with testing performed on Neon for the database and Render for hosting verification.

[Next Presenter] will discuss the impact of our solution."

  - Environmental Impact (Green icons)
  - Economic Benefits (Blue icons)
  - Social Impact (Purple icons)
- Key metrics with numbers

### Script:
"QuickDineFlow delivers measurable benefits across three key areas.

Environmentally, we reduce food waste by 20-25% through better demand forecasting. The system eliminates 90% of paper consumption through digital menus and receipts, and operates efficiently with cloud-based infrastructure.

Economically, institutions save 15-25% in operational costs while increasing revenue by 10-15% through increased convenience and order volume. Students save 10-15 minutes per meal, time that can be redirected to academic activities.

Socially, the system is WCAG AA accessible, ensuring students with disabilities can use it fully. Bilingual English-Arabic support with proper RTL layout ensures inclusivity for diverse student populations. The mobile-first responsive design works seamlessly on any device.

[Next Presenter] will wrap up with our implementation status and future plans."

## SLIDE 7: Implementation Status & Future
**Presenter 6** | **Duration: 65 seconds**

### Visual Content:
- Progress bar showing 96% completion
- Implementation checklist
- Future roadmap timeline with icons

### Script:
"Our implementation status is excellent. We've completed 78 out of 81 functional requirements—that's 96% complete. All core features are fully implemented and tested: authentication, menu browsing, ordering, payment processing, real-time tracking, admin dashboard, and analytics.

Minor features like email notifications and saved payment method UI are in progress but don't affect core functionality. The system is production-ready and has been thoroughly tested on Neon and Render platforms.

Looking ahead, our roadmap includes exciting enhancements: email and SMS notifications, personalized menu recommendations using machine learning, a loyalty program with points and discounts, native mobile applications for iOS and Android, campus card integration, and multi-location support for larger institutions.

The system is ready for deployment on Replit and can begin serving students immediately."
