\section{Introduction}
QuickDineFlow is a web-based smart cafeteria ordering system designed to revolutionize the dining experience for students at educational institutions. The system enables students to pre-order meals online, skip queues, and pick up orders at their convenience, while providing kitchen staff with an efficient administrative interface to manage menu items and track orders in real-time.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
Traditional cafeteria systems often suffer from long queues during peak hours, inefficient order management, and limited visibility into order status. Students waste valuable time waiting in lines (typically 10-15 minutes per meal), while kitchen staff struggle to manage orders efficiently and provide timely service.

\subsection{Solution Overview}
QuickDineFlow addresses these challenges by providing:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Student Interface}: An intuitive web application for browsing menus, placing pre-orders, and tracking order status in real-time
    \item \textbf{Admin Interface}: A comprehensive dashboard for kitchen staff to manage menu items, monitor orders, and generate analytics
    \item \textbf{Real-time Updates}: WebSocket-based communication for instant order status updates
    \item \textbf{Payment Integration}: Secure payment processing through Stripe, supporting both card and cash payments
    \item \textbf{Bilingual Support}: Full English and Arabic language support with RTL layout capabilities
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Development Environment}
The software was developed on \textbf{Replit}, a cloud-based development platform. The deployment is performed directly from Replit. For testing purposes, \textbf{Neon} (PostgreSQL database) and \textbf{Render} (hosting platform) were utilized.

    \item Order 1---* OrderItem (one-to-many)
    \item MenuItem *---* Favorite (many-to-many)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sequence Diagrams}

\subsubsection{Authentication \& User Management}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth,page=1]{Sequence Diagrams.pdf}
\caption{Authentication \& User Management Sequence Diagram}
\label{fig:seq_auth}
\end{figure}

\textbf{User Registration Flow:}
The User enters registration data, which is sent to the API. The API checks email existence, hashes the password using bcrypt, creates the user in the database, and creates a session using Passport.js. The user is automatically logged in.

\subsubsection{Menu Browsing \& Display}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth,page=2]{Sequence Diagrams.pdf}
\caption{Menu Browsing \& Display Sequence Diagram}
\label{fig:seq_menu}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Menu Browsing Flow:}
The sequence begins with the Student browsing the menu, which fetches items from the API and DatabaseStorage. Students can search, filter by category, and view item details with real-time availability updates.

\subsubsection{Order Tracking \& User Notifications}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth,page=3]{Sequence Diagrams.pdf}
\caption{Order Tracking \& User Notifications Sequence Diagram}
\label{fig:seq_tracking}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Order Status Update Flow (Admin):}
The Admin views orders through KitchenDisplayPage. When status is updated, the API updates the database, creates an audit log entry, and broadcasts via WebSocket. The student's OrdersPage receives the real-time update and refreshes the UI.

\subsubsection{Order Placement Flow}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth,page=4]{Sequence Diagrams.pdf}
\caption{Order Placement Flow Sequence Diagram}
\label{fig:seq_order}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Order Placement Flow (Card Payment):}
The sequence begins with the Student browsing the menu and adding items to cart via CartContext. At checkout, a payment intent is created through Stripe. After successful payment, the order is created in the database, and a WebSocket broadcast notifies the admin kitchen display. The cart is cleared, and the student is redirected to the Orders Page.

\subsection{Activity Diagram}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{Activity diagram.pdf}
\caption{Activity Diagram - Complete User Journey}
\label{fig:activity}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Complete User Journey:}
The flow begins with user accessing the landing page. New users register (validate form, check email, hash password, create user, auto-login), while existing users login. Students are redirected to menu browsing where they can search, filter, and add items to cart. At checkout, first-time customers receive a 10\% discount. Users select pickup time and payment method. For card payments, Stripe processes the payment. Orders are created, broadcast via WebSocket, and users are redirected to order tracking.

\textbf{Order Status Update Flow (Admin):}
Admin views kitchen display, selects an order, and updates status through the workflow: received → preparing → ready → completed. The update is saved to database, logged in audit logs, and broadcast via WebSocket.

\section{Design}

\subsection{Database Design}

\subsubsection{Database Schema}
The database consists of nine main tables:

\textbf{Users Table:} Stores user accounts (Primary Key: id UUID) with fields for email, password (hashed), firstName, lastName, studentId (10-digit, unique), role (student/admin), profileImageUrl, phoneNumber, preferredPickupLocation, dietaryRestrictions, allergies, and stripeCustomerId.

\textbf{Menu Items Table:} Stores menu items (Primary Key: id integer) with fields for name, nameAr, description, descriptionAr, price, category, imageUrl, isAvailable, preparationTime, isSpecial, specialPrice, nutritionalInfo (JSONB), allergens, dietaryTags, and sizeVariants (JSONB).

\textbf{Orders Table:} Stores orders (Primary Key: id integer, Foreign Key: userId) with fields for orderNumber (unique), status, pickupTime, specialInstructions, subtotal, tax, total, paymentMethod, paymentIntentId, and paymentStatus.

\textbf{Order Items Table:} Links orders to menu items (Primary Keys: id, Foreign Keys: orderId, menuItemId) with fields for menuItemName, quantity, unitPrice, selectedSize, customizations, and subtotal.

\textbf{Additional Tables:} Favorites (links users to menu items), Sessions (stores authentication data), Audit Logs (tracks admin actions), Feedback (stores customer feedback), and Payment Methods (stores saved Stripe payment methods).

\subsubsection{Database Relationships}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{One-to-Many}: User → Orders, Favorites, Feedback, Payment Methods
    \item \textbf{One-to-Many}: Order → Order Items
    \item \textbf{Many-to-Many}: Users ↔ Menu Items (via Favorites)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Indexing Strategy}
Primary keys are automatically indexed. Unique constraints exist on users.email, users.studentId, and orders.orderNumber. An index on sessions.expire supports session cleanup. Foreign key indexes optimize join performance.

\subsection{GUI Design}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{order.png}
\caption{Student Menu \& Ordering Interface}
\label{fig:gui_student}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{pay.png}
\caption{Payment \& Checkout Interface}
\label{fig:gui_payment}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Design Principles}
The GUI follows Material Design 3 principles:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Efficiency First}: Minimize clicks from browse → order → pay
    \item \textbf{Clear Role Hierarchy}: Distinct interfaces for students vs. admins
    \item \textbf{Progressive Disclosure}: Critical information upfront, details on demand
    \item \textbf{Mobile-First}: Optimized for students on mobile devices
    \item \textbf{Desktop-Optimized}: Admin workflows designed for larger screens
\end{itemize}
